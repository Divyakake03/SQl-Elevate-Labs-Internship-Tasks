# SQL Internship – Task 3  
##  Basic SELECT Queries Using Employee, Department & Project Tables

This repository contains the SQL script for **Task 3** of the SQL Developer Internship Program.  
The objective of this task is to practice writing **SELECT**, **WHERE**, **ORDER BY**, **LIKE**, and **LIMIT** queries based on the database created in Tasks 1 and 2.

## Files Included
| File Name     | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `task3.sql`   | SQL script containing all SELECT queries with comments |
| `README.md`   | Documentation explaining the task and queries |

## Database Tables Used

- **departments**
- **employees**
- **projects**
- **employee_project**

These tables were populated and cleaned in previous tasks (Task 1 & Task 2).

## Task Objective
Write SQL queries to:

- Retrieve all rows from tables  
- Select specific columns  
- Filter data using conditions  
- Sort results  
- Use pattern matching with `LIKE`  
- Limit the number of rows  
- Perform `JOIN` operations

##  Queries Included
The script contains:

1. Show all employee records  
2. Display employee names and salaries  
3. Employees belonging to the IT department  
4. Employees earning above 40,000  
5. Projects with valid start dates  
6. Salary-based ordering  
7. Limiting results  
8. Pattern matching (names starting with "D")  
9. Date range filtering  
10. Joining employees with their departments

##  Outcome
By completing Task 3, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Filtering** data  
- **Sorting** records  
- **Selecting** specific fields  
- **Joining** tables  
- Applying **conditions** and **patterns**  
- Understanding database relationships

##  How to Run
1. Open **DB Browser for SQLite** or **MySQL Workbench**  
2. Import/Connect to the database you created in Task-1,Task-2 
3. Run the `task3.sql` script  
4. Verify the query outputs
