# SQL Internship – Task 4
## Aggregate Functions and Grouping

This repository contains the SQL script for Task 4 of the SQL Developer Internship Program.  
The purpose of this task is to practice using aggregate functions and grouping to summarize and analyze data.

## Files Included

task4.sql – SQL script containing all aggregate and grouping queries with comments  
README.md – Documentation explaining the task and included queries  

## Database Tables Used

departments  
employees  
projects  
employee_project  

These tables were previously created and populated during earlier tasks and contain the necessary data for performing aggregation.

## Task Objective

The objective of this task is to write SQL queries that demonstrate:

Use of aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX  
Grouping data using GROUP BY  
Filtering grouped results using HAVING  
Summary and analytical operations on employee and project data  

## Queries Included in task4.sql

1. Count of total employees  
2. Average salary of employees  
3. Total salary expenditure per department  
4. Number of employees grouped by department  
5. Maximum and minimum salary values  
6. Departments with more than one employee using HAVING  
7. Average salary grouped by department  
8. Number of employees assigned to each project  
9. Summary of project participation using GROUP BY and JOIN  

## Outcome

By completing this task, we  learn to:

Use aggregate functions to summarize data  
Group dataset records for categorized analysis  
Apply HAVING to filter aggregated results  
Work with JOIN operations while performing aggregation  
Generate analytical insights from relational tables  

## How to Run the Script

1. Open DB Browser for SQLite or MySQL Workbench  
2. Load or connect to the database created during Task 1  
3. Execute the task4.sql script  
4. Review the results produced by each query
